# Mini-Project | Module 2 (Individual part)


## Introduction

The goal of this project (part 1) is to apply the statistical concepts that you have learned so far to real-world data both to practice and better understand how these concepts are useful. 


## Getting Started

This lab consists of two parts: Data cleaning & Exploratory data analysis. You should begin with '1.-Data Cleaning.ipynb', and then move on to '2.-EDA.ipynb' as you will want to use the clean dataset you build in part 1 to complete part 2. 


## Expectations

- Write clean, well-commented code
- Fully explain your responses where necessary
- Refer to the lecture notes if you have questions


## Deliverables

- '1.-Data Cleaning.ipynb' with your responses
- '2.-EDA.ipynb' with your responses


## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
